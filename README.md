## About the repository

This repository contains the source code for the HTML5 applications contained in Identity Manager.

It is a monorepo containing the Angular [workspace](https://angular.io/guide/workspace-config), which consists of apps and [libraries](https://angular.io/guide/libraries).

We strongly recommend to read the [HTML Development Guide](https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/identity-manager/9.2/html5-development-guide) before starting to work with the code in this repository.

By forking this repository, you may create customized versions of the projects and add them to your Identity Manager deployment.

## Workspace overview

Each Angular library and app belongs to a folder in the `projects` directory. The workspace is defined in the `angular.json` file.

### Angular libraries

| Name  | Type                   | Dependencies inside the workspace |
| ----- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `qbm` | Angular library        | none                              |
| `qer` | Angular library        | `qbm`                             |
| `tsb` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `att` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `rms` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `rps` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `aad` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`, `tsb`               |
| `aob` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `uci` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `cpl` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `hds` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `dpr` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`                             |
| `o3t` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`, `tsb`               |
| `olg` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |
| `pol` | Angular plugin library | `qbm`, `qer`                      |

Each Angular library belongs to the Identity Manager module of the same name. You do not need to build Angular libraries for modules that are not part of your Identity Manager installation.

A (non-plugin) library acts like a regular compile-time dependency. A _plugin_ library is loaded dynamically at runtime, as determined by each plugin's `imx-plugin-config.json` file.

For more information about each project, see the `readme.md` files in each project's folder.

### Angular apps

| Name                        | Description                                       | Project type | Static dependencies |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------- |
| `qbm-app-landingpage`       | API Server landing page and Server Administration | Angular app  | `qbm`               |
| `qer-app-portal`            | Portal                                            | Angular app  | `qbm`, `qer`        |
| `qer-app-operationssupport` | Operations Support Portal                         | Angular app  | `qbm`, `qer`        |
| `qer-app-pwdportal`         | Password Reset Portal                             | Angular app  | `qbm`, `qer`        |
| `custom-app`                | Template for custom applications                  | Angular app  | `qbm`               |

## Installing Node.js

Verify that you have installed a compatible `node.js` version for your branch. The version used by the CI build is defined in the [`.github/workflows/npm-build.yml`](.github/workflows/npm-build.yml) file in the `node-version` property. Other versions of `node.js`, including newer versions, are not guaranteed to be compatible with other Angular versions. Please see the [version compatibility table](https://angular.io/guide/versions) on the official Angular site.

## Building

To install the required dependencies, run `npm install` in the root folder of the workspace.

To build any library or app, run `npm build <name>`. Note that you must build each library in the correct order; along with any plugins that you want to include. For example, to build `qer-app-portal`, you need to build at least the following in this order:

- `qbm`
- `qer`
- `qer-app-portal`

## Customizing libraries

When changing the code of a _library_, you will need to build and deploy customized versions of all the apps that should use the customized versions. For example, changing `qer` will require that you also compile `qer-app-portal`, `qer-app-operationssupport` and `qer-app-pwdportal` because all of these apps include `qbm`.

When changing the code of a _plugin library_, you will need to build and deploy customized versions of the plugin library itself, and all plugin libraries depending on it. For example, changing `tsb` will require that you also compile `aad` and `o3t` because these plugins include `tsb`.

### Debugging

Running and debugging web applications is possible using the default tools of the Angular CLI toolchain. For example, you can use `ng serve qer-app-portal` to debug the Portal app.

You will need an API Server instance that the web applications will connect to. You can host an API Server locally for development purposes. Run the following command on the command line:

```
imxclient.exe run-apiserver -B
```

The web apps will connect to the API Server using the URL defined in the application's `environment.ts` file. The default setting is `http://localhost:8182` which is the default URL that a local API Server will run on.

## Getting started

Please refer to the [HTML Development Guide](https://support.oneidentity.com/technical-documents/identity-manager/8.2.1/html5-development-guide#TOPIC-1801966) for step-by-step instructions on getting started.

Please also see the [version compatibility table](https://angular.io/guide/versions).

We plan to push updates for each minor and major product release, allowing developers to track source code changes from one version to the next. Occasionally we may also publish important bug fixes.

## Documentation

There are two ways to install the documentation locally. The result will be stored in _\imxweb\documentation\<projectname>_.

### 1. Using Compodoc (preferred)

1. Install the Compodoc package globally by running `npm install -g @compodoc/compodoc`.
2. Navigate to the library to create documentation for (e.g. `imxweb\projects\qer`).
3. Run `compodoc -p tsconfig.lib.json` for a library or `compodoc -p tsconfig.app.json` for an application.

### 2. Using npm only

This method only works for `qbm`, `qer` and the applications.

1. Navigate to _imxweb_.
2. run `npm run doc:<projectname>`
